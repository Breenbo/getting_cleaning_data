# Getting and Cleaning Datasets - R script

## How to make it work
- Unzip the UCI HAR Dataset.zip wherever you want
- DON'T rename the files or the directories
- if the script is in the same directory than the UCI HAR Dataset directory, you don't have to write the path of the UCI HAR Dataset
- to have a dataset with only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurements, call *mean_std(path to the UCI HAR Dataset, including "UCI HAR Dataset"
)*
- to create a txt file with the average of each mean and standard deviation for each activities and each subjects, call *average_data(path to the UCI HAR Dataset, including "UCI HAR Dataset")*
